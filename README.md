# Mango-Leaf-Segmentation-and-Color-Feature-Extraction-using-U-Net

This project implements a full pipeline for mango leaf image segmentation using a custom U-Net architecture. It uses the Roboflow dataset interface to download YOLO-formatted training data, processes labels into masks, trains a U-Net model on image segmentation, and extracts HSV-based color features from the segmented regions.

ðŸš€ Features
âœ… Automatic dataset download via Roboflow

âœ… Converts YOLO-style bounding boxes to binary masks

âœ… Custom U-Net model for binary image segmentation

âœ… Training pipeline with Dice, IoU, Precision, Recall evaluation metrics

âœ… Segmentation of test images

âœ… HSV color feature extraction (mean & std per channel)

âœ… Saves features to a CSV file for downstream analysis
